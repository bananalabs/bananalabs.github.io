## Personal projects

As a web developer and a parent, I'm most passionate about the use of technology for social impact and education.
Below are a couple of side projects that I'm currently working on.

### boycottNRA browser extension

This a cross-browser extension that informs users of sites that currently support the NRA. The user can choose to block or allow the site. Note that this is not an anti-second-ammendment project. It's my contribution as a techie parent to support sensible laws on the use of guns.

### Olipie

Olipie is a YouTube player for kids with parental controls. This HTML5 app provides a simple and clean interface to watch videos. Primary features include enhanced safe search and monitoring by flagging inappropriate videos. Olipie was originally built using Angular 1.0 and Django. This is a re-write using Typescript, React, Redux, Node.JS.
